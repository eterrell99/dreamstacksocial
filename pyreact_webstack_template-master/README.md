# Here is a basic webstack template that you can use to save time when starting a new project.
# This template is for a very simple webstack that uses the Django and Rest Frameworks to serve React.js as a compiled webpack.js bundle.
# The template out of the box provides Webpack.js and Babel.js preconfigured along with the DRF configured to properly serve the bundle as a static file.
# While this template gets you started the DRF backend and React frontend are almost completly empty giving you an easy shortcut to speed up your setup process.
